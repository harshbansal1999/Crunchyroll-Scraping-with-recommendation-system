0,RADIANT,31 Videos,https://www.crunchyroll.com/radiant,Read the Manga if you want the FULL experience of Radiant Short and Sweet Review The first three episodes were promising Little skeptical at first but highly enjoyable after Gets Better Further On Great show needs more stars Decent but nothing Unique Overall pretty good fun watch The last chaps are 10 Takes a bit to get going but it is badasssssss  Hopeful for 2nd season to continue faster If anyone watched fma brotherhood and liked it its show for you Could Be A Lot Better Radiant is Radiant just as Grimm is Grimm Very enjoyable fun show Its fun nothing more nothing lesswhy i dont get it just adapt the damn manga page for page the black clover anime is better than this pile of whatever it is Doesnt capture the full story or tone of the mangaThe next big thing!! Review based on Episode 1 its naruto but worse FIRST Review ever Very watchable great visuals It gets better trust me A boy and his friends go hot air ballooning The Progression of Radiant Better than Black Clover Was curious for a new anime to watch Definitely Worth it No sense in fixing what aint (all the way) broke Inverse Black Clover in a way My personal view on Radiant Nothing Wrong With This Anime  Its Great! Good Not Great But Thats OkayWTF! Just on animation decent action nothing else It gets better as you go definition of meh Just another generic shounen (Quick review) Kinda Boring and generic Really liking it so far Episodes 14 Watch the First 3 Episodes Interesting first steps For those you like one piece or fairy tail Well I meanits something Its not that bad manAwesome Animation and Character Designs Give it a chance! (psst Its worth it)Skip this show its generic Find out how in my description of the show A Generic But Well Constructed Shoenen First episode impression A meandering story from one point to another Had potential at first but loops with filler and pointless tasks Just a worse version of Black Clover looking pretty good! This anime went nowhere real fast Its Like Fairy Tail but With less CleavageMost of the onestar reviews are premature great show !!!!!!!!!! I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT! Didnt read the manga  butFun series to get started on! I really like this show! cute fun show beautifully drawn Terrible Awful No An Anime like a Wind Hunter x hunter clone but still good anyways Its fun exciting and pretty shonen animeOne Amazing Showww  w Radiant might be my next favorite Interesting Worldbuilding; but it could have done more Not exactly revolutionary but definitely enjoyable For shounen anime its goodI find this show to put off a nice vibe 3 Episodes watched so cliche it hurts to watch Reminds Me Of Hunter x Hunter First Episode Review (Good but not enough to stand out) Episode Zero  Because nothing much happens Read the manga if you want manga Its that simpleThis show is so poorly written and anyone who says otherwise is a simpleton Another great title! Amazingly Great Fantasy Leftist propaganda from a french comic disguised as anime Youll find out near the end it was all for notep 13 Radiant shows its true colors Has a lot of potentialgreat show The characters suck but it has potential This anime is so bad and it only has 2 episodes so far I want my 10 minutes back,0.19750823451910415,Mixed Reviews
